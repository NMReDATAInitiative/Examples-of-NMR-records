This is compound 1 from Yaouba, S.; Valkonen, A.; Coghi, P.; Gao, J.; Guantai, E.M.; Derese, S.; Wong, V.K.W.; Erdélyi, M.; Yenesew, A. Crystal Structures and Cytotoxicity of ent-Kaurane-Type Diterpenoids from Two Aspilia Species. Molecules 2018, 23, 3199 (https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/23/12/3199).

The molecule contains some explicit hydrogens in the publication, but not all. NMReDATA has all hydrogens explicit. In the assignment, some labels are assigned using the HX notation, whereas others use the explicit atom number. It is possible (though not recommended) to mix the two notiations. There is a one 1H spectrum, where the peaks have varying degrees of annotation (multiplicities, integrals, coupling constants). For the 13C spectrum, intensities are given throughout, but no multiplicities. There are 2d spectra, all containing crosspeaks defined by a pair of labels. No further information about the peaks is given, but this could be done in NMReDATA. Metadata including correlation type and frequency are given for them. The LEVEL of the file is 0, so we have no ambigious assignments.
