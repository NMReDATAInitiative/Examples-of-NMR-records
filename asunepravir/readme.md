Asunaprevir is an experimental drug candidate for the treatment of hepatitis C. The file contains 13c and 1h 1D spectra. There are COSY, TOCSY, HSQC-EDITED, HMBC, and NOESY 2d spectra. There are two 1H spectra, the second one has #2 appended. There is a NMREDATA_J section for coupling constants.  There are not explicit hydrogens, but there are diastereotopic hydrogens. The are assigned by labels H23a/b and H24a/b. It is not possible to see to which actual hydrogens these belong.

**PS:** Note that this is not really an NMR Record because it does not contain the spectra and is not a zip file.
