This structure does not have explicit hydrogens. There are no instance of diastereotopic hydrogens, this justifies to leave the hydrogens out. There is a one 1H spectrum, where all peaks have multiplicity and integral annotation. For the 13C spectrum, intensities are given throughout, but no multiplicities. Notice there is a line consisting of a comment only, referring to something which is not a peak. This would be for human readers only, and not be processed by a machine. There are 2d spectra, all containing crosspeaks defined by a pair of labels. No further information about the peaks is given, but this could be done in NMReDATA. Metadata including correlation type and frequency are given for them. The LEVEL of the file is 0, so we have no ambigious assignments.
