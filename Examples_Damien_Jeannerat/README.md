**Beware...**
<span style="color:red">
**The data in this repository are not following the NMReDATA format.**

Or are only used to illustrate some specific aspects of the format.

They were produced using the Mnova script located here: https://github.com/NMReDATAInitiative/Mnova_export_script

Updated May 11th 2019 by Damien Jeannerat
J coupling in menthol example (in the May folder) were corrected (Manually- could not verify values and consistency yet...)

# Examples of NMR records
These examples were generated by a Damien Jeannerat using an "experimental" qs script running on Mnova V.11.

### Menthol_explicit_ax_eq_full_assignments_with_J
Includes a NMREDATA_J tag with assigned homonuclear coupling constants.
(used for demo of assignment validation using comparison of experimental with simulated spectrum).
Note that it does not include a DOI, it is therefore not ready for submission to a journal.

### Examples of ZIPed NMReDATA records
These examples are "working" examples with diverse features for test (coupling to 19F, etc.). We do not guaranty that they fullfill the requirements of the format.

### Manually generated .sdf files can be found in the May_2019_series folder
To test additional char 10
To test reading NMREDATA with assigned J
