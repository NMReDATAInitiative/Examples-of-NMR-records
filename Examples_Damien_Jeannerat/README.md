# Examples of NMR records
These examples were generated by a Damien Jeannerat using an "experimental" qs script running on Mnova V.11.

### Menthol_explicit_ax_eq_full_assignments_with_J
Includes a NMREDATA_J tag with assigned homonuclear coupling constants.
(used for demo of assignment validation using comparison of experimental with simulated spectrum).
Note that it does not include a DOI, it is therefore not ready for submission to a journal.
This folder was too large (>100 MB) to be accepted on github it was therefore uploaded with full file structures.

### Examples or NMReDATA records
These examples are "working" examples with diverse features for test (coupling to 19F, etc.). We do not guaranty that they fullfill the requirements of the format.
