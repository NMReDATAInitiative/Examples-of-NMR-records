J coupling in menthol example (in the May folder) were corrected (Manually- could not verify values and consistency yet...)

# Examples of NMR records
These examples were generated by a Damien Jeannerat using an "experimental" qs script running on Mnova V.11.

### Menthol_explicit_ax_eq_full_assignments_with_J
Includes a NMREDATA_J tag with assigned homonuclear coupling constants.
(used for demo of assignment validation using comparison of experimental with simulated spectrum).
Note that it does not include a DOI, it is therefore not ready for submission to a journal.

### Examples of ZIPed NMReDATA records
These examples are "working" examples with diverse features for test (coupling to 19F, etc.). We do not guaranty that they fullfill the requirements of the format.

### Manually generated .sdf files can be found in the May_2019_series folder
To test additional char 10
To test reading NMREDATA with assigned J
