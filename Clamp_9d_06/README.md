This structure does not have explicit hydrogens. There are no instance of diastereotopic hydrogens, this justifies to leave the hydrogens out. There is a one 1H spectrum, where most peaks have multiplicity, coupling constant, and integral annotation. For the 13C spectrum, multiplicities are given throughout. There are 2d spectra, all containing crosspeaks defined by a pair of labels. No further information about the peaks is given, but this could be done in NMReDATA. Metadata including correlation type and frequency are given for them. The LEVEL of the file is 0, so we have no ambigious assignments.
